      "content": "T.A. 3001:\nThe day after the Birthday Party, Frodo manages the inheritance of Bilbo's belongings and distributes his parting gifts.\nThe rumor spreads crowds of hobbits come to loot Bag End and seek treasure; including the Sackville-Bagginses who also demand to see Bilbo's will.\nAt the evening Gandalf visits Frodo, warning him not to use the Ring and keep it secret. He changes his plans[1] and begins seeking Gollum.[2]\nT.A. 3018:\nFour Riders enter the Shire before dawn. The others pursue the Rangers eastward, and then return to watch the Greenway.\nMerry Brandybuck loads a cart with the remainder of Frodo's luggage and leaves for Crickhollow with Fatty Bolger.[3]\nAfter lunch Folco Boffin leaves Frodo with Pippin. Lobelia visits Bag End with Lotho to inspect.[3]\nKhamûl comes to Hobbiton at nightfall and interrogates Gaffer Gamgee, who directs him to Buckland. Frodo leaves with Sam and Pippin.[3]\nThe three hobbits walk west of Hobbiton, traverse the Water, and after supper they join the road leading to Bucklebury. They camp in a fir-wood.[3]\nAfter taming Shadowfax, Gandalf leaves Rohan and heads for Rivendell.\nBoromir travels towards Rivendell to ask for counsel."
