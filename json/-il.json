			"content": "-il is a little-attested ending in the Sindarin language,[note 1] used sometimes to denote feminine gender. Its masculine counterpart is -on.\n\nIts presence causes i-affection to the vowels of the stem (cf. brannon and brennil)."

		{
			"title": "Etymology",
			"content": "Possibly it derives from a Common Eldarin ending *-illê. This is supported by several Quenya words which end in -illë with Sindarin cognates in -il; most notably compare the Quenya amille \"mother\" and the Sindarin emil."
