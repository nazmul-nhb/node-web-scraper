			"content": "↑ In editions prior to the 50th Anniversary Edition, the Tale of Years mentions two events on this day in T.A. 3019: Gandalf returning to life, and the Mirror of Galadriel-sequence. Since it is clear from the narrative that the latter event occurred one day before departure on 16 February, this causes a problem in the chronology. Hammond and Scull decided to fix the Tale of Years so that the Mirror of Galadriel-sequence happened on 15 February. The return to life of Gandalf was also moved to this date, for reasons unclear."
