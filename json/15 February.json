			"content": "In earlier editions the Tale of Years lists the two events of T.A. 3019 at 14 February. Since it is clear from the narrative that the latter event occurred one day before departure on 16 February, this causes a problem in the chronology. In the 50th Anniversary Edition, Hammond and Scull decided to fix the Tale of Years so that the Mirror of Galadriel-sequence happened on 15 February. The return to life of Gandalf was also moved to today, for reasons unclear."
