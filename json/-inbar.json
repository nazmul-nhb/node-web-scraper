			"content": "The word derives from the Root N-B-R,[1] which was mistyped as Root M-B-R[2] in The Treason of Isengard.[3]\n\nMagnus Åberg speculated that the actual word might be *nibar or *mibar since words of three radical vowels such this don't begin with a vowel, but the form given in Parma Eldalamberon 17 is merely inbar.[1] The currently-unpublished notes on Khuzdul phonology and root modifications may shed light on this matter.[4]"
