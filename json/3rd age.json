In the meantime the Elves, Dwarves and other peoples did little new; also known as the Fading Years, the Age marked the waning of the Elves.\n\nIt lasted for 3021 years, only ending after the defeat of Sauron had finally and utterly been achieved by destroying his Ruling Ring. With the One Ring gone, the power of three rings waned and the realms that had been preserved by them began to fade. These events prompted many of the Eldar remaining in Middle-earth to sail for the Uttermost West, and so much memory and beauty were lost to Middle-earth for ever. After the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings, the Fourth Age began."
