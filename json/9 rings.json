      "content": "The Nine Rings were made along with the other Rings of Power in Eregion and were forged by Elven smiths under the guidance of Sauron.[1] They were kept in the House of the Mírdain, but all rings save the Three Elven rings were captured by Sauron when he attacked Eregion.[2] He gave nine of them to Men, and it was said that three of those that received them were Númenórean lords,[3] and another was from the East.[4]\n\nThe owners of the Nine were corrupted, amassing glory and riches, and becoming great among Men. They had the ability to become invisible, and their lives were extended unnaturally, until they fell at last to the power of the One Ring held by Sauron. They became part of the wraith-world, permanently invisible, and were enslaved by Sauron. They were afterwards his greatest servants, terrible to behold, known as the Nazgûl.[1]\n\nDuring the end of the Third Age, Sauron had apparently reclaimed the Nine Rings to himself.[5][6]"

      "content": "In The Council of Elrond, Gandalf indicates that the Nazgûl kept their Rings by saying, \"The Nine the Nazgûl keep\".[7] However in many other references, it is indicated that Sauron later held the Nine Rings.[5][6][8] Furthermore, Frodo does not see any Rings on them on Weathertop, and it is believed that if they did wear the Rings, they would have been fully invisible (including their cloaks).[9]\n\nIt is possible that the line in the Council of Elrond represents Tolkien's earlier intention that the Nazgûl should still be wearing their Rings; if that is so, he later changed his mind and simply missed revising that sentence.[9]"

These include a revived Isildur and Talion, the game's main protagonist; Suladân, an original character; and original characters Riya and Yuka, sisters who killed their rings' previous owners and claimed them only to become wraiths themselves. Helm Hammerhand is also depicted as receiving one of the Nine from both Sauron and Celebrimbor in a clear breach of the timeline established in canon."
