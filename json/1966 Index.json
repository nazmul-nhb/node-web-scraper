This index was a revision of an index that was compiled by Nancy Smith in 1958 based on the requirements of J.R.R. Tolkien for \"an alphabetical list of all proper names of persons, places, or things .. in the text (including Foreword and Prologue, but not the Appendices)\". It was combined with an index of songs and verses that was compiled by Baillie Klass.[1]\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien added some notes and 'translations' and selected citations to the appendices to the index for the Allen & Unwin second edition of 1966.[1]\n\nIn 2005 a new, enlarged index[1] was compiled by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull independent of the previous index, but J.R.R. Tolkien's added notes and translations were retained within square brackets.[2]"
